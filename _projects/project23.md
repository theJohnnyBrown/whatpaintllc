title: "Interior Repaint"
description: "We completed a full‑interior refresh, coating the kitchen, living areas, bedrooms, and hallways in a modern greige that brightens every room while pairing clean white trim for crisp contrast. Before spraying and rolling, our team sealed off furniture, floors, and fixtures with plastic sheeting and precise blue‑tape lines to guarantee razor‑sharp edges and zero overspray. The finished home now feels cohesive, airy, and move‑in ready—an inviting showcase of meticulous prep and flawless, even coverage."
